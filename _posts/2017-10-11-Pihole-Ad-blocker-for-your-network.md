**Pihole briefly a ad-blocker application which can be directly deployed in Linux machines to clean the network from advertisements. A Raspberry-pi will do the job very neatly if dedicated computer is your primary concern.**

As we all know, common ad-blocker application will do the job in some extent but this one can make the difference, I can tell you that. Installation is as simple as copy-paste one-line command from the official website. After the successful installation we are provided with a assigned IP which should be put into the DNS part of the devices. DNS-level ad-block is the most highlighted features of Pi-hole as we don't have to configure anything in the access side by configuring the router to have DHCP client use the Pi-hole installed device as their DNS server.

We could also install Pi-hole in our personal laptop/desktop if you don't want any dedicated device for the same. 

Pi-hole provides information-rich web interface which through we could keep track of the stats and change settings. We can find it at:
