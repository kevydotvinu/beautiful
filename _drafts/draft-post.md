**What is Docker?**
Docker is a tool designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers. Containers allow a developer to package up an application with all of the parts it needs, such as libraries and other dependencies, and ship it all out as one package. By doing so, thanks to the container, the developer can rest assured that the application will run on any other Linux machine regardless of any customized settings that machine might have that could differ from the machine used for writing and testing the code.

**Why do I use Docker?**
The prime most reason of using docker is portability of application which I use everyday life such as Jekyll. Since I use different Linux distributions across machines from my place to office I could find docker would be the perfect solution for creating instant environment which my application needs. And it is completely different from conventional virtual machines, as you can see here. [dockervsvm](/img/dockervsvm.png) I use virtual machines but not for specific needs like website designing and distribution related terminal testing. When you switch to Docker from conventional virtual machines, you could free up considerable amount of  machine resources as well.

**How to install Docker?**
Docker installation is well-described in the Docker [documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) page for any operating system which you are using. I always recommend you to install Docker from official website instead of installing from your Linux-distribution-repository or other - a good practice of installation.

**How to start using Docker**
Now you are installed Docker and let's start using it. Here, I'm not going to go through the Docker tutorials which you could find easily from Docker official website, instead, I give you a brief of how is Docker useful to me.
